# ## Evaluation

# %% [markdown]
# Evaluating our model will require a bit more work, as we will need to map the predictions of our model back to parts of the context. The model itself predicts logits for the start and en position of our answer: if we take a batch from our validation datalaoder, here is the output our model gives us:

# %%
import torch

for batch in trainer.get_eval_dataloader():
    break
batch = {k: v.to(trainer.args.device) for k, v in batch.items()}
with torch.no_grad():
    output = trainer.model(**batch)
output.keys()

# %% [markdown]
# The output of the model is a dict-like object that contains the loss (since we provided labels), the start and end logits. We won't need the loss for our predictions, let's have a look a the logits:

# %% [markdown]
# 
# We have one logit for each feature and each token. The most obvious thing to predict an answer for each feature is to take the index for the maximum of the start logits as a start position and the index of the maximum of the end logits as an end position. This will work great in a lot of cases, but what if this prediction gives us something impossible: the start position could be greater than the end position, or point to a span of text in the question instead of the answer. In that case, we might want to look at the second best prediction to see if it gives a possible answer and select that instead.
# 
# To classify our answers, we will use the score obtained by adding the start and end logits. We won't try to order all the possible answers and limit ourselves to with a hyper-parameter we call n_best_size. We'll pick the best indices in the start and end logits and gather all the answers this predicts. After checking if each one is valid, we will sort them by their score and keep the best one. Here is how we would do this on the first feature in the batch. And then we can sort the `valid_answers` according to their score and only keep the best one. The only point left is how to check a given span is inside the context (and not the question) and how to get back the text inside. To do this, we need to add two things to our validation features:
# * the ID of the example that generated the feature (since each example can generate several features, as seen before);
# * the offset mapping that will give us a map from token indices to character positions in the context.
# That's why we will re-process the validation set with the following function, slightly different from `prepare_train_features`:

# %%
n_best_size = 20

# %%
